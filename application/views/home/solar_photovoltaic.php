                <h1>Solar Photovoltaic</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">PV, the technology which converts sunlight directly into electricity, is among the fastest growing segments of the renewable energy industry. It is already well established in many countries including India, and looks set to become one of the key technologies of the 21st century. Some of the factors driving the growth of this segment are: concerns towards carbon emissions, energy security and the rising prices of fossil fuels.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional solar cells are made from silicon, and are generally the most efficient. Thin-film solar cells made from amorphous silicon or non-silicon materials such as cadmium telluride are the second-generation solar cells, and are gaining a greater share in overall installations.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Third-generation solar cells use a variety of new materials and nanotechnology etc. for designing high efficiency PV materials. These systems are expected to rapidly become cost effective for use by utilities and industry.</p>
               <h5>Grid Connected PV</h5>
               <p style="text-align: justify;">Large scale PV plants are used for electricity generation that is fed into the grid. Such systems typically consist of one or more photovoltaic (PV) panels, a DC/AC power converter/inverter, racks, mounting fixtures, and electrical interconnections. Additionally, such systems could also include maximum power point trackers (MPPT), battery systems and chargers, solar trackers, software for energy management, solar concentrators etc. The electricity generated is either stored, used directly for self-consumption, or is fed into large electricity grids.</p>
               <p>Grid connected projects may be either i) Ground Mounted PV or ii) Rooftop PV</p>
