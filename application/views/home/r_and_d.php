                <h1>R & D</h1>
                 <p style="text-align:justify;">Solar power cost reduction potential is highly correlated with the efficiency improvement in solar technologies. <?php echo APP_NAME;?> has envisaged a progressive and focused research infrastructure development. <?php echo APP_NAME;?> is a member of the Solar Energy Research Advisory Council (SERAC) constituted by MNRE to analyze the existing research infrastructure in solar sector and then to set up a framework which would incubate a conducive environment for accelerating research and development activities in the country in alignment with the vision of JNNSM. The various activities being taken up by <?php echo APP_NAME;?> are as follows:</p>
                <h4>Solar Radiation Activity</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><?php echo APP_NAME;?> is working on a R&D project for setting up calibration facility for solar radiation measuring sensors in collaboration with Solar Energy Centre. The project also has the objective of solar radiation data analysis at select locations.</p>
                <h4>Solar-wind-battery integrated Demonstration Project</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;"><?php echo APP_NAME;?> is planning to set up a 2.5 MW capacity demonstration plant at Himachal Pradesh, in collaboration with Himurja. Project Site has been finalised. Tendering process would commence soon.</p>
                <h4>Solar Guidelines</h4>
                <p style="text-align:justify;">An initiative under the Indo German Energy Forum (IGEF), SOLAR GUIDELINES is a web-based platform for encouraging rapid development of the solar power sector in India by facilitating dissemination of information and latest updates on the development of solar energy projects, policy frameworks announced by Central and state governments from time to time, regulatory framework announced by CERC, Regulations of the MoEF, Contractual Agreements (PPA/PSA), and procedural details of approval and clearances required for timely commissioning of solar projects in the country. It is envisaged to evolve into a one-stop information and facilitation portal for all stakeholders in the solar sector that would help create an investment friendly environment and give a fillip to the sectorâ€™s growth.</p>
